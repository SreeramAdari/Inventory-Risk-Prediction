# Inventory-Risk-Prediction
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict inventory risk — classifying items as either "stockout" or "overstock" — based on 7 key inventory features. It includes full data preprocessing, model training with SMOTE balancing, and a Streamlit web app for deployment.
